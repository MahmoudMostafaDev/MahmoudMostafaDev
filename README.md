## 🕶 Mahmoud Mostafa 

**`Passionate React Developer`**

I am a Frontend React Developer and Computer Science student at Alexandria University with a GPA of 3.6/4. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS (Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS), JavaScript, and the React ecosystem. My skills extend to data structures, algorithms, and OOP. While my primary focus is on frontend development, I have also dealt with backend technologies like Node.js and Express, demonstrated through a Reddit clone project. I am passionate about software engineering and continuously improving my skills to deliver high-quality, user-centric solutions
